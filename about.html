                <p>Our missions is to bring transparency back into food production.  Over the years, the farm has moved further and further away from those they serve.    As a society, we have chosen convenience over value and this has caused a separation between the growers and the consumers.  Consumers are no longer part of the conversation when it comes to how their food is grown or handled and this can put them at risk.  By bringing the farm into the city, people can see exactly where their food is coming from and how it can be grown responsibly. The technology now exists to produce food in a safe and sustainable way for the consumers, the workers, and the environment.  The farmer is no longer some distant acquaintance, but rather a prominent face in the community they serve.</p>

                <p>Our goal is to provide you with the highest possible quality of food.  Growing indoors, we are able to tailor optimal growing conditions for every specific plant in the system.  We are growing fresh, organic, food locally.  The average head of lettuce will have traveled 1200 before it reaches your plate and begins to lose its nutritional value as soon as it leaves the soil.  The uniqueness of our growing system allows you to pick up your produce while it is still growing â€“ meaning you have access to that plant when it is at its peak nutritional content!</p>
				<p class="mission"> <span style="color:#a6c53a">More About Hygro</span></p>
	        	<p>Hygro Farms, Inc is a startup aquaponics farm located in the Hamilton County area.  The Company was founded to produce fresh, organic, local food in an urban setting.  Aquaponics combines two farming technologies: hydroponics and aquaculture.  Stand-alone these technologies are very inefficient; create large amounts of waste and are not sustainable.  Properly integrating these technologies will create highly efficient, nutritious and sustainable farming.  Leveraging the latest technology in lighting, hydroponics, and aquaculture, Hygro Farms has designed a unique and innovative Aquaponics farming system.  The system is intended to meet the nutritional needs of community by providing them with sustainably raised protein and vegetables.  The Farm will produce a cleaner, more nutritious, organic product that that can contribute to the sustainability of our food supply. </p>
